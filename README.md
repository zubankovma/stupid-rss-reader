# stupid-rss-reader

I'm tired of different stupid RSS clients and I created own Stupid RSS Reader.

Try it [here](https://gurov.github.io/stupid-rss-reader/)

## Philosophy
The application does not impose anything, but only executes orders.

## Features
* Stupid RSS is [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)
* You can install it to your smartphone
* Very simple interface
* Offline mode
* Angular 8
* All user data are stored locally only
* The last 100 posts are stored. Deletion occurs after downloading new ones
* Open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/gurov/stupid-rss-reader)
